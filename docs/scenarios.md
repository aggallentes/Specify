## Scenarios
User stories can be seen as placeholders for conversations that are purposely kept terse while in the backlog (Desirements). 

Scenarios document the conversation that took place with the customer (Requirements). They are the product ownerâ€™s acceptance criteria for the user story. 

## Scenarios are Specifications
Scenarios are high-level specifications of what the system should do. They document the conversation with the business. 

Unit tests are low-level specifications of how the system works. They are a conversation amongst the developers. 

## Scenarios should focus on business rules
All the steps should reflect the business rules (the what), not the technical implementation (the how). 

One suggestion is to [pretend there is no UI](http://itsadeliverything.com/declarative-vs-imperative-gherkin-scenarios-for-cucumber).
